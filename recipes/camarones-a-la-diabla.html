    Description
  </h2>
    <p>
      If you love chile peppers as much as I do, you’re going to love these Camarones a la Diabla! Also known as diablo shrimp or Mexican deviled shrimp in English, this dish features juicy, large shrimp covered in a bright red chile pepper sauce that’s spicy, super flavorful and very addicting.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 dried guajillo chiles</li>
      <li>3 dried chile de arbol chiles</li>
      <li>3 Roma tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 medium white onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt</li>
      <li>4 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1.5 pounds large raw shrimp</li>
      <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium bowl or saucepan, add dried guajillo and arbol chiles. Add very hot or boiling water until chiles are fully submerged. Cover with a lid or large plate and let sit for 15 minutes, until chiles have softened.</li>
      <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer the softened chiles to a large blender. Add the tomatoes, garlic, onion and salt. Puree until completely smooth. Taste and season with more salt, if necessary. If the sauce is too spicy, add more tomatoes.</li>
      <li>Heat a large saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and shrimp. Cook shrimp for 1 minute per side, or until shrimp is light pink.</li>
      <li>Add the red chile sauce to the pan or skillet and mix together to coat the shrimp. Lower the heat to medium and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling and hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
