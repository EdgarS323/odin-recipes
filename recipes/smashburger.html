<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The Smashburger was popularized by a fast-casual hamburger restaurant chain of the same name founded in Denver, Colorado. They have a proprietary system of smashing their burgers and cooking them quickly. It creates a thin patty, with a caramelized, crispy crust. Top it with cheese and all the fixings and you’re in for a real treat.</p>
<br>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons pickle juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon diced pickle</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoons sesasoned salt</li>
    <li>1 pound 80/20 ground chunk</li>
    <li>4 potato hamburger buns</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon butter, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 head green leaf lettuce, washed dried</li>
    <li> 1 medium tomato, sliced</li>
    <li>1/2 medium red oninon, sliced</li>
    <li>6 slices American cheese</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In a small bowl combine the mayonnaise, mustard, pickle juice, and diced pickles. Set aside until you’re ready to assemble your burgers.</li>
  <li>In another small bowl combine the kosher salt, black pepper, and seasoned salt.</li>
  <li>Loosely divide the ground beef into four even balls. Season the balls of beef with a 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Don’t worry about completely covering them. You can add more seasoning when they are cooking.</li>
  <li>Wrap a heavy skillet (cast iron works well) with some foil, you will use this to smash the burgers. I use a smaller 8-inch cast iron skillet, but any smaller size will work.

    Turn on the fan over the stove and open a window to help with air flow.
    
    In a large skillet or griddle (I do not recommend using non-stick) set over medium-high heat add one tablespoon of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the beef balls.
    
    Place the foil wrapped skillet or a spatula over the beef balls and smash them into flat disks. Smash each burger for 10 seconds, one at a time, applying a lot of pressure to it. Repeat until all the burgers are smashed.</li>
  <li>Season the smashburgers with another 1/8 teaspoon burger seasoning mix. Allow them to continue to cook for about 90 seconds until the juices start to bubble from the burger. Use a sturdy metal spatula to flip the burgers, being sure to scrap up any caramelization.</li>
  <li>After you’ve flipped the burgers, add cheese (I like 1 1/2 slices per burger) and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes, until burgers are cooked to desired doneness, usually medium. The burger is so thin that there’s no need to check temperature. It will be done if the burger has a good caramelization on the outside. You can continue to cook for another 30 seconds if you want a very well done burger.</li>
  <li>While burgers cook, toast the buns. In a large skillet over medium heat add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Add the buns, cut side down, and toast for 30 seconds, until golden. Repeat until all buns are toasted. If you have a griddle, you can toast the buns alongside the burgers.</li>
  <li>Build a smashburger by adding some sauce, approximately 1 tablespoon, to the bottom of the burger bun. Add lettuce over the top of the sauce, then add a smashburger, and finally top with sliced red onion and tomato. Continue until all smashburgers are assembled.
