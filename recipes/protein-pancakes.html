    Description
  </h2>
    <p>
      Listen to this – these protein pancakes on their own have no refined sugar because banana’s got your back. Also – no refined grains with a special s/o to oats on that one. Lots and lots and lots of protein – from protein powder if you want (I use this collagen protein that a few friends recommended to me, and Bjork uses some kind of flavored whey protein that I turn my nose up to a little bit, and everyone has their own preferences for these things, right? so I say just choose on that works for you and get on with your pancake self) and/or protein just from the eggs and egg whites. This is an everyone-wins club.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Cup oats</li>
      <li>1 Banana</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup egg whites</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>a pinch of salt</li>
      <li>a pinch of cinnamon</li>
      <li>1-2 scoops of protein powder (about 1/4 cup, or 29 grams)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon flax meal</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Run everything through the blender on medium low speed until very well mixed.</li>
      <li>Heat a nonstick griddle to medium high heat. Add batter in small circles – about 1/4 cup per pancake. Sprinkle with blueberries or chocolate chips if you want. When the edges start to look dry (2-3 minutes), flip and cook another minute or two on the other side.</li>
      <li>Top with anything you like! I like syrup and peanut butter and chocolate chips.</li>
    </ol>
